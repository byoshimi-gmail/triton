### How to run a Triton Community Meetup

Contributors:  Bill Yoshimi, Areg Melikadamyan, Whitney Tsang, Ksharma Pawar

Last updated: June 26, 2025

Community meetups give the on-line community a chance to interact with each other and the Triton developers in a more face-to-face format vs slack chats.  Example topics covered during community meetups include:
* Developers presenting updates on features they’re working on.
* Developers asking community for feedback on new initiatives
* Questions from community for developers
* Questions about Triton strategy/direction.


## Some logistics

Community meetups occur once 8 weeks (usually during the first 1-2 weeks of a month).
Reminders are sent out 2 weeks ahead of time

Only companies that paid for corp Microsoft Teams access can create webinars.  Three folks who have done this (or have access in the past are):
* Areg Melikadamyan
* Whitney Tsang
* Ksharma Pawar
* Jian Hui

Webinars are automatically recorded.  The person with corp access can upload the video to youtube after the webinar is finished.

Only the person with corp access can open a webinar.  Even if you’re a registered speaker or MC, you’ll see

before the meeting owner opens it up.

During the meetup, take notes.

## How to run a community meetup

1. Work with one of the folks above to create a Microsoft Teams webinar (occurring 6-8 weeks in the future).  Template:

<pre>
Title: “Triton Community Meetup (online)”
External presenter: **“<your name>”**
Co-organizer: **add organizers**
    Date: **Add date**
    Time: 10:00-11:00 PDT
    Duration: 1 hr
    Recurring meeting: link **(created by XXX@YYY.com)**
</pre>

2. If you don’t have details about the meeting (e.g. meeting ID, passcode, phone number, etc.) you can login to the meeting, click on More -> Meeting Info and get data that way.

3. Copy the invite generated from the meeting to two places:
  * [triton #general chat](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T01379XQ9FG/C013E22BPPC) on slack
  * [GPU MODE #triton chat](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fchannels%2F1189498204333543425%2F1189607595451895918%2F1387620920306438206).
Example text to use in chat:

<pre>
The next community meetup will be on <date> from 10am-11am PST. The meeting link is below. If anyone has agenda items to add for the meetup please reach out to me.

Thanks,
**<your name>**

</pre>

4. 1-2 Days before the meeting. Verify that someone with corp Microsoft Teams access will open the meeting up for you.
5. Day before meeting, send chat reminder (reply to your original chat on both slack and discord):
Reminder, this month's community meetup is tomorrow at 10am PST.

<pre>
Agenda:
   Topic #1 <who>
   Topic #2 <who>
</pre>

6. Day of meeting, login a little early and verify everything is working as expected.

7. During the meeting, keep an eye on the comments section. Some folks might post questions for the speaker there and/or issues they're having with Teams.

8. After the meeting has finished, work with the person with corp Microsoft Teams access to upload the recorded video to youtube.  Post the youtube link in [triton #general chat](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T01379XQ9FG/C013E22BPPC) and [GPU MODE #triton chat](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fchannels%2F1189498204333543425%2F1189607595451895918%2F1387620920306438206).

If this is your first time using Microsoft Teams, work with the meeting creator to test out the UI (e.g. logging in, verifying your camera, audio work, verifying you can present your screen if using that functionality, play around with hand raising, play around with people/attendees/muting others, log off and log back in again.)

## How to upload videos to Youtube
